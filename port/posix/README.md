#Posix Port

The Posix port provides multiple and fully functional implementations of different wolfHSM abstractions that can be used to better understand the exact functionality expected for different hardware abstractions.

The Posix port provides:
- POSIX TCP transport
- POSIX Shared Memory transport (using shm_open)
- POSIX Flash device (using a flat file as a backing store)
